<h1 align="center"> Hey ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<p>
  Since September 2021, our working group has been meeting regularly in Lyon in order to discuss language processing topics. Our ambition is to share the difficulties we encounter in our respective projects and the solutions we implement to overcome them, to give feedback on the use of NLP tools and to carry out the widest possible common monitoring. We also contribute to impactful open source projects in NLP.

  The members of the group come from different backgrounds and hold various positions: team leader, CTO, PhD, AI/ML engineer, R&D engineer, MLOps... This mix brings to the group a multidisciplinarity and a broad vision of the subjects thanks to the variety of perspectives.
